	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to express the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run as a function of the input size. It is crucial for evaluating how well an algorithm performs as the input size grows.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <b>O(n)</b> indicates that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
