	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is by analysing the amount of time it takes to run as the size of the input increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute and store data as the input size increases, for example, O(n) means the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
