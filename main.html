	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a efficient way to analyze an alogorithm.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) indicates that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
